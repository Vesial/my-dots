## Introduction
This project aims to overhaul my entire Linux dotfiles. I've been using my current dotfiles for about a month, and now that my system is close to needing a reinstallation, it's time to reinstall my beloved machine once more.


## Basic information
**OS:** Arch Linux  
**WM:** bspwm    
**Wallpaper:** all of which are included within the dots       
**Terminal:** kitty  
**Fonts:** Fira Code                            
**Editor:** Neovim  
**Menu:** rofi  
**Bar:** Polybar  

### Packages
You'll need these following packages, preferably with yay aur helper:
* bspwm
* bspwm-rounded-corners
* kitty
* rofi  
* picom-git (the ibhagwan version is used here)
* polybar
* brightnessctl

**AUR**

```bash
yay -S bspwm bspwm-rounded-corners kitty rofi picom-ibhagwan-git polybar brightnessctl
```

## Flaws
- Of course, there are a lot of changes that need to be made and, as such, it might take way longer to configure the dotfiles.

## To-do
- [x] polybars
- [x] rofi-theme
- [x] fish       
- [ ] notification
- [x] logout interface (rofi)
- [ ] lightdm theme

## Noted
- I will not create an install script of any kind so don't even ask for it.

- The preview pic is not representative of the current dots as I have made a lot of changes, but it should look a lot like it.
