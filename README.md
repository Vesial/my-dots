## Introduction
This project is aim to revamps my whole Linux dotfiles, I have been using my current dotfiles for around a month or so, and with my machine getting to the point of reinstallation, It's time for me to rerice my beloved machine again.

This also serves as a practice time for me when it comes to Bash and Linux management.
This setup is based on one of my old rice, but with rounded corner thanks to the advancement of science 

## Basic information
**OS:** Arch Linux  
**WM:** bspwm    
**Wallpaper:** all of which are included within the dots       
**Terminal:** kitty  
**Fonts:** Fira Code                            
**Editor:** Neovim  
**Menu:** rofi  
**Bar:** Polybar  
**Music player:** ncmpcpp + mpd
## Flaws
- Of course there are a lot changes that needs to be made and as such might take way longer to configure the dotfiles.

## To-do
- [x] polybars
- [x] rofi-theme
- [x] fish
- [x] music player
- [ ] notification
- [x] logout interface (rofi)
- [ ] lightdm theme

## Noted
- I will not create an install script of any kind so don't even ask for it.

- The preview pic is not representative of the current dots as i have made alot of changes but it should look a lot like it.
